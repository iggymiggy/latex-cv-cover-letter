% Letter Content (override base defaults)
\renewcommand{\letteraboutme}{%
  I build safety-critical systems where reliability, clarity, and evidence matter more than hype. Over the last decade I have led incident-driven engineering programs, written safety cases for complex socio-technical systems, and partnered with product, infrastructure, and security teams to turn ambiguous risks into measurable controls.
}

\renewcommand{\letterwhycompany}{%
  Hyperion BioSystems sits at the intersection of software, hardware, and regulated environments—exactly where engineering discipline becomes a competitive advantage. I’m excited by work that requires rigorous design reviews, traceability, and continuous verification, while still shipping fast enough to make a difference for customers.
}

\renewcommand{\letterwhyme}{%
  I’m effective in roles that combine technical depth with operational ownership: defining safety requirements, aligning stakeholders, and building the tooling and processes that keep systems safe at scale. I bring a pragmatic approach—prioritizing high-impact mitigations, instrumenting what matters, and continuously learning from incidents and near-misses.
